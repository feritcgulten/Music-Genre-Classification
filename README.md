# Music-Genre-Classification using Spectograms(2D CNN)
This is a music genre classification project made for 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' course during the master degree

The purpose of this project is classifying music genres
based on their spectrogram using CNN model. The goal of
this is getting higher accuracy compared to other classification
models. In the project, the CNN is used as a classification
model since the image representation of the audio files are
used. The project is consists of multiple data pre-processing
steps to get the image representation of the audio files and
labeled the data
